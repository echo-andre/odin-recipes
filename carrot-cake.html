            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Brazilian recipe for carrot cake. The chocolate sauce will harden and form a shell as it cools.</p>
            
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups of white sugar</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>3 carrots, quartered</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Chocolate Sauce:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder</li>
                        <li>6 tablespoons milk</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan and dust with flour.</li>
                    <li>Combine 2 cups sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and carrots in a blender; blend until very smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour carrot mixture into a bowl; add flour and baking powder. Mix well to combine. Pour into the prepared cake pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.</li>
                    <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, milk, and butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to bubble and thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly spread over cake.</li>
                </ol>
